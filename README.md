Problem statement: “To design a touchscreen interface for an Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) geared towards kids aged 10-15 whose parents have opened a savings account for them. These ATMs will be located in public places, such as at malls. They can be used to encourage kids to save money. This new unit has touchscreen style (with multi-touch) and no physical buttons”.
